    <p>I grew up in a small town by the name of Anderson, South Carolina. There, I found a passion for technology. And by passion I mean my family made me fix or setup anything that had a wire because they didn't know how and I enjoyed doing it. Recently I changed my major at the College of Charleston to Computing in the Arts (A fancy word for a Computer Science major with a minor in Studio Arts) and I love it. I decided to pick up an HTML and web development elective and finally found what I want to do with my life. I also picked up a photography class and have been rolling with that ever since too. So with all this being said...I present my website. I want to show the world my two passions: photography and web development. I will try to constantly update my website with posts, photos, videos, etc. so the world will enjoy just as much as I do. </p>

<p>P.S- It's literally impossible to find a civilized picture of myself so bear with me on the many faces of Devin you will see throughout the site.</p>
