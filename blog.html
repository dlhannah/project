	<h4> December 4, 2013:</h4>
		<p>It's finals week here at the College of Charleston and I am getting ready to finally finish this site. Hopefully I will be able to do everything that I want and if not, there is plenty of time to add and spruce it up along the way. </p>	
	<h4> October 16, 2013:</h4>
		<p>Getting back from a Fall Break that was much needed put me a little behind schedule. I am still working on all of the same pages as before but this time, I hope to actually get done. Sorry about the minor setback. One day you will actually be able to see the full page in action. </p>
    <h4>October 9, 2013:</h4>
   		<p>I am currently working on creating a "Contact Me" and "About Me" page for the site.It should be up and running within the next few weeks. :) Can't wait to hear your opinions about the work I'll be posting. Hope everyone is enjoying this fall weather. I know I am.</p>
    <h4>My first blog: October 1, 2013:</h4>
    	<p>I am so ecstatic to be starting my own website. Obviously this site is still under construction and will be for the rest of the semester. I will try to post pictures, stories, and links of all of my favorite things to keep things interesting for you guys.
